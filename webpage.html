    <u><h2><i>Basic Instructions:</i></h2></u><br>
    <font size="4" style ="color:black;">1)Players takes turns to make a move. X usually goes first.<br>
    2)A move consists of placing oyour letter(X or O) on an empty square of the board in such a way that it captures one or more of the opponent's letter.<br>
    3)A letter is captured if it is placed adjacent to an opponent's letter (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) in such a way that there are one or more of your letter on the other side of the captured letter (The opponent's letters should get sandwiched between your letters in order to be captured by you)<br>
    4)When a player captures letters, they flip them to their own letter.<br>
    5)Players must make a move if they have a legal one. If a player cannot make a legal move, their turn is passed on to the opponent.<br>
    6)The game continues until the entire board is filled, or neither player can make a legal move.<br><br></font>

    <u><h2><i>End of the Game:</i></h2></u><br>
    <font size="4"style ="color:black;">The game ends when the board is full, or when neither player can make a legal move. The player with the most of their letters on the board wins.<br><br></font>
    
    <u><h2><i>Strategies:</i></h2></u><br>
    <font size="4"style ="color:black;"><u>Corner Squares:</u> Letters placed in the four corner squares are very valuable, as they cannot be flipped by the opponent.<br>
    <u>Edge Squares:</u> Letters placed on the edges of the board are also strong, as they have fewer potential directions to be flipped.<br>
    <br>
    The player with the most of their respective letter is the winner.<br><br>
    
    <I>Othello is a game of strategy and pattern recognition. The key is to control the board and anticipate your opponent's moves.<br> The simple rules lead to complex and deep gameplay. Enjoy playing Othello!<I></font>
